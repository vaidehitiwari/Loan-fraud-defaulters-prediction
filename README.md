Loan Fraud Defaulters Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to predict loan defaulters using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical loan data, the model identifies patterns and features that indicate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The dataset used in this project contains various attributes related to loan applicants, such as credit history, income, loan amount, and more. This predictive model can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions during the loan approval process, minimizing the risk of non-performing assets (NPAs).

Objectives





Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key factors influencing loan defaults.



Preprocess and clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.



Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict loan defaulters.



Provide actionable insights for financial institutions to optimize loan approval processes.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical loan data with features such as:





Applicant demographics (e.g., age, income)



Loan details (e.g., loan amount, term, interest rate)



Credit history (e.g., credit score, past defaults)



Employment details (e.g., job type, years of employment)



Other financial indicators (e.g., debt-to-income ratio)

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size or privacy concerns. Please ensure you have access to the relevant dataset before running the code.
